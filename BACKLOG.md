# CIG System Backlog

Future tasks and improvements for the Code Implementation Guide system.

## Task: Rollout Task 11 - Secure Argument Parsing

**Task-Type**: chore
**Priority**: High

Deploy the updated CIG command files with secure argument parsing pattern. All 8 workflow commands (cig-plan, cig-requirements, cig-design, cig-implementation, cig-testing, cig-rollout, cig-maintenance, cig-retrospective) have been updated with LLM-level format validation to prevent command injection. Changes are currently on local branch `bugfix/11-only-pass-needed-args-to-scripts`. Rollout involves creating PR, merging to main, and monitoring for any issues in production usage.

## Task: Security Review and Hardening of CIG Bash Invocations

**Task-Type**: discovery
**Priority**: Medium

Comprehensive security review and hardening of all bash invocations in the CIG system to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. Task 11 revealed that LLM-level validation is critical for security.

**Scope**:
1. **Systematic review**: Audit all command files (`.claude/commands/cig-*.md`), helper scripts, and workflow documentation for places where user input reaches bash
2. **Fix vulnerabilities**: Apply secure argument parsing pattern to any vulnerable commands (known candidates: cig-subtask.md, cig-status.md)
3. **Complete testing**: Run TC-8 testing coverage for all commands (8 workflow commands + cig-subtask + cig-status) with special character patterns (quotes, backticks, shell metacharacters)
4. **Document threat model**: Create comprehensive threat model with attack scenarios, existing defenses, and mitigation strategies

**Related to**: Task 11 (secure argument parsing pattern implementation)

## Task: Extract CIG Argument Validation Pattern to Documentation

**Task-Type**: feature
**Priority**: Needs-Triage

Create reusable documentation for the secure argument parsing pattern developed in Task 11. This pattern (LLM validates format → extracts arguments → invokes bash with literals) prevents command injection and handles arbitrary user input safely. Should be documented in `.cig/docs/` for use in future CIG commands or similar systems. Include: (1) Security model explanation, (2) Format validation regex patterns, (3) Example implementation, (4) Test scenarios.

## Task: Standardize Exit Codes to errno-Style Values

**Task-Type**: chore
**Priority**: Low

Consolidate exit codes across all CIG helper scripts to use errno-compatible values for better semantic meaning and consistency. Currently, exit codes are inconsistent across scripts (e.g., exit 3 means "Missing required argument" in hierarchy-resolver.pl but "No parent tasks" in context-inheritance.pl). Proposed standard:
- 0 = Success
- 2 = ENOENT (No such file or directory) - for "not found" errors
- 13 = EACCES (Permission denied) - for permission errors
- 22 = EINVAL (Invalid argument) - for validation errors

Scripts to update: hierarchy-resolver.pl, context-inheritance.pl, status-aggregator.pl, format-detector.pl, template-version-parser.sh, and any future helper scripts. Update documentation in script headers and `.cig/docs/` to reflect standard.

## Task: Improve status-aggregator.pl Error Message Clarity

**Task-Type**: chore
**Priority**: Low

Improve error message in `status-aggregator.pl` to clarify that it expects a task number (e.g., "17", "1.2.3"), not a full file path. Current error "Invalid task path format: 17-feature-new-helper-script-to-setup-templates-for-new-task" is confusing because users might provide the directory name or full path. Updated error should say something like "Error: Invalid task number format. Expected decimal notation (e.g., '17', '1.2', '1.2.3'), not a file path or directory name." This improves usability by helping users understand the correct input format immediately.

## Task: Fix d-implementation.md Template to Reference e-testing.md

**Task-Type**: chore
**Priority**: Low

Remove duplicate "Test Coverage" and "Validation Criteria" sections from d-implementation.md template and replace with static reference to e-testing.md. Currently the d-implementation.md template (`.cig/templates/pool/d-implementation.md.template`) contains:
1. **Line 67-70**: "Test Coverage" section with placeholder test cases
2. **Line 72-76**: "Validation Criteria" section with test-related checkboxes

**Problem**: This creates confusion about where tests belong and duplicates content between d-implementation.md and e-testing.md. The testing phase (e-testing.md) should be the single source of truth for test strategy, test cases, and validation criteria.

**Solution**:
1. Verify all 5 task types (feature, bugfix, hotfix, chore, discovery) use e-testing.md.template (VERIFIED: all include it)
2. Replace "Test Coverage" section with: "**See e-testing.md for complete test plan**"
3. Replace "Validation Criteria" with: "**See e-testing.md for validation criteria and test results**"
4. Keep "Implementation Steps" as-is (includes Step 3: Testing and Step 5: Validation which reference executing the tests defined in e-testing.md)
5. Update any existing tasks using the old template pattern (consider migration script or manual update)

**Rationale**: Maintains single source of truth for testing, eliminates confusion about workflow phase responsibilities, and follows DRY principle.
