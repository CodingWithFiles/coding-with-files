## Scope & Boundaries

**This step**: Now you run tests. Execute test cases from e-testing-plan.md and document results in g-testing-exec.md.
**Not this step**: Planning tests (that's e-testing-plan), fixing bugs (that's f-implementation-exec), or deployment.
**If blocked or finished**: Call `workflow-manager control --current-step=g-testing-exec --task-path=<path>` to determine next action.

## Context

**Task arguments**: {arguments}
**Current task/workflow**: !/current-task-wf

!{bash}
.cig/scripts/command-helpers/context-manager location

## Workflow

**Steps 1-4 (Preamble)**: Read `.cig/docs/commands/workflow-preamble.md` and follow Steps 1-4 (argument parsing, task resolution, parent context, LLM decision).

**Step 5**: Read `e-testing-plan.md` for test strategy, test cases, and success criteria.

**Step 6 (Execute)**:
- Open g-testing-exec.md and update as you work
- **Focus on**: Executing planned tests, recording results, documenting failures
- **Avoid**: Changing the test plan (update e-testing-plan.md if needed)
- Status: "Testing" when starting, "Finished" when all pass, "Blocked" if environment issues

**Step 7**: Execute test cases systematically. Record PASS/FAIL, document failure details with reproduction steps, measure coverage.

**Step 8**: Checkpoint commit. See `.cig/docs/commands/checkpoint-commit.md`. Stage: `g-testing-exec.md`

**Step 9 (Next Steps)**:
- **Primary**: Move to rollout → `/cig-rollout <task-path>`
- **Alt**: Return to `/cig-implementation-exec` to fix bugs
- **Alt**: Return to `/cig-testing-plan` to add tests
- **Alt**: Return to `/cig-design-plan` if tests reveal design flaws

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Task directory resolved, test plan reviewed
- [ ] All functional test cases executed with results recorded
- [ ] Non-functional tests executed (if applicable)
- [ ] Test failures documented with reproduction steps
- [ ] Test coverage metrics recorded
- [ ] Next steps suggested with reasoning
